#Net Deployment on Amazon EKS
---
## Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of developing and deploying a Registration App using Amazon EKS, embodying modern DevOps practices. By integrating a range of advanced tools and technologies, this project highlights how to achieve a robust, scalable, and secure application environment.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon EKS manages and scales containerized applications efficiently, ensuring high availability and performance.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment processes, facilitating rapid and reliable application updates.
- **Code Quality Management**: SonarQube continuously assesses code quality and technical debt, promoting high standards and maintainability.
- **Continuous Deployment**: ArgoCD enables GitOps-based continuous deployment, streamlining the deployment process in Kubernetes environments.
- **Security Assurance**: Trivy performs thorough vulnerability scans, securing the application from potential threats.
- **Containerization**: Docker packages the application and its dependencies into consistent, portable containers, simplifying deployment and scaling.
- **Source Code Management**: GitHub supports effective collaboration and version control, enabling smooth development workflows.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of how to leverage contemporary DevOps tools and cloud-native technologies to deliver scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.
